# Beginning x64 Assembly

Notes and code as I'm working through the book [Beginning x64 Assembly Programming: From Novice to AVX Professional](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-x64-Assembly-Programming-Professional/dp/1484250753/ref=sr_1_1)

The most significant thing of my own in here is the bits of experimentation that deviate from the examples as they are strictly presented within the book, as well as the create_asm_project script.
